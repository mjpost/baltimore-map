# Object-oriented configuration: each top-level key represents a map layer or visual element
# with its styling attributes grouped together.

# Primary suggestion	#B9C8D3	Desaturated blue-gray; reads “water” but stays quiet.
# Slightly greener variant	#B6C7C2	Leans toward teal, harmonizes more tightly with your park green.
# Cooler gray option	#C2CCD2	If you want it almost neutral, minimal color cast.
# Print-safe darkening	#A7BBC8	If proofs come out too light; better contrast against land.
